			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I attend the University of Mary Washington. I am studying Biology and Buisness Administration. I currently work in the business marketing field with interests in breaking into hospital administration/management. At my previous position at the <em>Freedom Aquatics & Fitness Center</em>, I recieved training in First Aid/CPR/AED and Medical Administrative Training (MAT). I am a member of the UMW RFC, Mother's Rugby. We achieved an undefeated season and became DIAA National Champions in our 2017-2018 season. I currently live in Fredericksberg, VA with my dog. In my free time I like to enjoy playing games with friends, read, and go to the gym.</p>
